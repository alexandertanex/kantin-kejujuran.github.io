SD SEA Sentosa has a special corner named “Kantin Kejujuran”. It consists of some items for sale by students and a box to store all the purchased money. Everyone is free to look around, sell, and buy items there. There is no shopkeeper there so everyone is also free to add or withdraw the money in the box. Let’s digitalize the feature!
