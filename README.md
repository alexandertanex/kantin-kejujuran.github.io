# kantin-kejujuran.github.io


Kantin Kejujuran is one of the task that was assigned during the Compfest Software Engineering Academy 2022 selection process.

Kantin Kejujuran is a unique shop concept where there is no shopkeeper. Unlike a futuristic/modern shop, Kantin Kejujuran relies on the customer's integrity and honesty. The project task is to create a website that can simulate a running digital shop with the concept of Kantin Kejujuran.

How to install and run the project?
  The project consist of 3 files which are index.html, styles.css, and logo.jpeg.
index.html is simply the main file for the entire project, which is complimented by some basic/standard styling by styles.css. logo.jpeg is the logo of the shop which was put as the favicon and in the top left corner of the website.

How to use the project?
  In the website project, anyone can deposit (pay) or withdraw money from the canteen's balance.
Upon clicking the "Pay/Deposit" button, client will be prompted on the amount of money they would like to pay. 
On the other hand, when clients wants to take some change after their payment or when they sold their item, they can withdraw money simply by clicking the "Withdraw" button. After clicking the button, client will be prompted on the amount of money they would like to withdraw. The maximum amount taken is the current canteen's balance i.e. if the client entered more than the canteen's balance, the canteen's balance will simply be 0. Due to the limited features of the website, inflation is diverging to infinity which make the e-money pretty useless.

If the height of the page is long enough such that it needs down-scrolling to reach the bottom, seller can simply click the right top corner button which is "Sell an item", and then the website will automatically scroll down to the item-selling form section.

To sell and item, seller just simply need to give some information about the items, such as their name, description, and price. When the information are set, seller should click submit and their items will immediately be listed in the website.

Unfortunately the product image and post-date features are not available yet due to time and resources constraints.


PS: 
This is my first project ever, and I am aware that there are too much flaws in this project. Looking to commit into software engineering and just keep getting better. Please pardon me.
